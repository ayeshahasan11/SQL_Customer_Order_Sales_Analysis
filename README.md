# ðŸ“Š SQL Customer Order & Sales Analysis

This project simulates a **real-world SQL data analysis workflow**, focusing on customer and sales data. It demonstrates my ability to write optimized SQL queries, build reusable reports, and extract actionable business insights.  

---

## Project Objectives  
- Apply **advanced SQL techniques** to analyze sales and customer data.  
- Create **reporting views** for ongoing performance tracking.  
- Deliver **insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product contribution**.  

---

## SQL Techniques Used  
- **Joins** (INNER, LEFT) for combining multiple tables.  
- **Window functions** (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM OVER, COUNT OVER) for time-series and segmentation.  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for modular query building.  
- **CASE WHEN logic** for categorization and conditional reporting.  
- **Aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) for performance metrics.  
- **Views** for reusable customer and product reports.
